## 📊 Database Schema

### **Account Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    UserName NVARCHAR(100),
    AccountNumber NVARCHAR(8),
    Balance DECIMAL(18,2),
    CreatedAt DATETIME
)
```

### **Payment Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Payments (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    AccountId INT,
    Amount DECIMAL(18,2),
    CreatedAt DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (AccountId) REFERENCES Accounts(Id)
)
```

## 🔄 Transaction Flow

1. User initiates payment
2. System validates payment details
3. Account balance is checked
4. Transaction begins
5. Balance is updated
6. Payment is recorded
7. Transaction is committed
8. Email notification is sent
